# Filtered Water

Filtered Water
We just got a big drum of water shipped to us and we need you to filter it. Write a function that takes a list of stuff in the water (array of strings) and a list of stuff to filter out (array of strings). Filter those things out and return the resulting array to us. Then you can get paid for your work. In water.

```javascript
Input: ["salt", "dirt", "calcite", "uranium", "rubber"], ["uranium", "dirt"]
Output: ["salt", "calcite", "rubber"]
```

Make a way for us to call your function from your webpage (via a button or some other easy way to test), then display the results in a watery fashion. You determine what watery is, so long as it is watery.

P.S. You don't need to ask for input from the user. We can edit the contents of the water and what things we want filtered out by editing your code. We do want to be able to easily call the filter function from the webpage though.
